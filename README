locale_selector provides a wrapper around the excellent ruby-gettext gem
http://www.yotabanana.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html

Offers a convinient way to specify the list of locales supported by your
application. Provides a html UI control for locale selection.
Maintains the user preference in a cookie and provides callback for
saving the preference e.g. in a database.

Tested with Rails 2.1 and gettext 1.92 and 1.93.

= Installation

For now just copy the stuff under your vendor/plugins folder.
Soon: `gem install locale_selector`

Please run `script/generate gettext_hacks` manually if you have installed
the plugin by just copying files and not through `script/plugin install`.

= Usage

Please see +LocaleSelector+ for API documentation and usage examples.

= Maintaining translations

Please use the provided rake tasks for maintaining translations.
Run <tt>rake -T gettext</tt> to see the list of provided rake tasks.

Most frequently used are

    rake gettext:updatepo

to extract the new strings from the application.
Note: please make sure, that all the database connections used
in your models work. Gettext connects to the database to extract
field names to be translated.


    rake gettext:makemo

for compiling the binary mo files from po-s.
